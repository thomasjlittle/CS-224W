Workflow:
split dataset
Convert all BigSMILES strings to SMILES
Convert all SMILES strings into graphs using existing code
  - Add features to all BigSMILES nodes indicating they are blocks
  - Add Mn, T, f_A features to graph
Run GAT/GCN for classification

Goal: 
recreate phase diagram for copolymers using GNN

Database: 
https://github.com/olsenlabmit/BCDB
Holds 5300 block copolymer melt phase measurements. Copolymer structure is stored in BigSMILES

use https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.rdmolfiles.html (specifically .MolFromSmiles to convert from SMILES to usable input maybe?)
look at https://github.com/coleygroup/polymer-chemprop-data/blob/main/datasets/vipea/make-polymer-fps.py for inspiration

also look at https://github.com/olsenlabmit/BigSMILEStoTuples for converting BigSmiles to tuples
