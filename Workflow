Workflow:


Goal: 
recreate phase diagram for copolymers using GNN

Database: 
https://github.com/olsenlabmit/BCDB
Holds 5300 block copolymer melt phase measurements. Copolymer structure is stored in BigSMILES

use https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.rdmolfiles.html (specifically .MolFromSmiles to convert from SMILES to usable input maybe?)
look at https://github.com/coleygroup/polymer-chemprop-data/blob/main/datasets/vipea/make-polymer-fps.py for inspiration

also look at https://github.com/olsenlabmit/BigSMILEStoTuples for converting BigSmiles to tuples

QUESTION: how to model edges / are there multiple edge conditions and if so how do I determine?
